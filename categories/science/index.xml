      <description>Last week, we presented new/s/leak for the first time in public: we had our demo session at the annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, which was held in Berlin this year. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t had the chance to attend (or you had and want to have some references now):
 Here&amp;rsquo;s the paper documenting our software (you&amp;rsquo;ll find a large part of the information from the paper in this blog, too) Here&amp;rsquo;s our poster (in PDF format)  And, of course, we took some pictures, testifying how much fun we had (click for larger versions):</description>

      <description>We already explained the language-related data wrangling happening under new/s/leak&amp;rsquo;s hood. For the success of new/s/leak, our second scientific field is the game changer: interactive visualization. No matter how much accurate information we can produce - if we cannot present them to the user in an appealing way, the tool will fail its goals. So how exactly is visualization science influencing new/s/leak?
Your daily dose of visualization science It might seem easy to create some kind of visualization (with Excel or even pen and paper) - however, there are lots of pitfalls that you need to avoid to create good visualizations.</description>

      <description>There are many reasons why data journalism needs new scientific approaches, and we have discussed some of them at length. So far we haven&amp;rsquo;t talked much about the reverse claim, which is, however, equally true: this journalistic project also advances science. So why are our scientists so passionate about the new/s/leak project? And what kind of scientific challenges do we face?
/S/cience on a Mission All our scientists agree that it&amp;rsquo;s an invaluable experience to work on real use cases, solving real-world problems and collecting extensive feedback from real users.</description>

      <description>Because of the Easter holiday season and several conference deadlines, this blog had to take a little break. Being back, we want to give a glimpse on the science behind of new/s/leak.
We have two camps of scientists working together: computational linguists contribute software that extract semantic knowledge from texts, and visualization experts who bring the results to smart interactive interfaces that are easy to use for journalists (after the computational linguists made the dataset even more complicated than before).</description>
