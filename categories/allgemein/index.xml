      <description>We present new/s/leak at a panel discussion at WissensWerte 2018, Germany&amp;rsquo;s most important dialogue forum for science journalists. On November 20, 2018 together with panelists from journalism, IT startups, and other universities, we will discuss how artificial intelligence contributes to journalistic work. In case of new/s/leak, we employ machine learning to automatically extract relevant information such as named entities and keywords from texts. This enables us to create interactive comprehensive visualizations of large text collections which contribute to a fast exploration for investigative purposes.</description>

      <description>Newsleak will be presented at the Social Informatics conference 2018 which takes place from 25-28th of September in St. Petersburg, Russia. The conference paper is published in LNCS series of Springer (here). A preprint can be found here.
Abstract: Investigative journalism in recent years is confronted with two major challenges: 1) vast amounts of unstructured data originating from large text collections such as leaks or answers to Freedom of Information requests, and 2) multi-lingual data due to intensified global cooperation and communication in politics, business and civil society.</description>

      <description>Since the first version of Newsleak, a lot has been improved behind the scenes as well as in the front-end of the software. We want to encourage journalists, to try out a pre-release of Newsleak 2.0 on their own. For this, we provide a software demonstration. This demo is populated with ca. 26,500 documents collected from Wikipedia in four languages (English, German, Hungarian and Spanish) and mostly centered on the topic of World War II.</description>

      <description>Last week, new/s/leak had its academic debut in the visualization science community at the Visualization in Practice Workshop, co-located with the IEEE VIS 2016 conference.
Here is the paper documenting the software with a focus on visualization. Needless to say that it&amp;rsquo;s always fun to present new/s/leak and get more feedback:
Thanks to everyone who came and visited us!</description>
