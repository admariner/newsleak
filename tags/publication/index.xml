      <description>Newsleak will be presented at the Social Informatics conference 2018 which takes place from 25-28th of September in St. Petersburg, Russia. The conference paper is published in LNCS series of Springer (here). A preprint can be found here.
Abstract: Investigative journalism in recent years is confronted with two major challenges: 1) vast amounts of unstructured data originating from large text collections such as leaks or answers to Freedom of Information requests, and 2) multi-lingual data due to intensified global cooperation and communication in politics, business and civil society.</description>

      <description>Last week, new/s/leak had its academic debut in the visualization science community at the Visualization in Practice Workshop, co-located with the IEEE VIS 2016 conference.
Here is the paper documenting the software with a focus on visualization. Needless to say that it&amp;rsquo;s always fun to present new/s/leak and get more feedback:

      <description>Our Paper &amp;ldquo;new\s\leak &amp;ndash; A Tool for Visual Exploration of Large Text Document Collections in the Journalistic Domain&amp;rdquo; has been accepted for presentation at the poster session of the Visualization in Practice Workshop, which is part of the IEEE VIS 2016 conference. The workshop will take place in Baltimore Maryland, USA on October 24-25.
VIS is one of the most important conferences in visualization science. new/s/leak fits perfectly in this year&amp;rsquo;s VIP workshop, the focus of which is design, development, distribution, and application of open source visualization and visual analytics software.</description>

      <description>Last week, we presented new/s/leak for the first time in public: we had our demo session at the annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, which was held in Berlin this year. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t had the chance to attend (or you had and want to have some references now):
 * Here&#39;s the [paper](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-4028.pdf) documenting our software (you&#39;ll find a large part of the information from the paper in this blog, too) * Here&#39;s our [poster (in PDF format)](http://newsleak.</description>

      <description>Franziska, who designed and documented our requirements analysis for her research seminar paper (Studienarbeit), turned this into an article accepted for SKILL 2016, titled &amp;ldquo;new/s/leak - Anforderungsanalyse einer interaktiven Visualisierung für Data-Driven Journalism&amp;rdquo; (in German - English translation: &amp;ldquo;new/s/leak - Requirements analysis of an interactive visualization for data driven journalism&amp;rdquo;).
Congrats Franziska, and of course thanks for the excellent analysis!</description>
