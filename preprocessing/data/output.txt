8078	2	High-profile hacking raises cyber security fears Please find an EXCELLENT hi-level ( a.k .a. , untechnical ) dispatch by the FT on computer ( in )security today ." Mr
8078	3	McClure [founder of cyber security company Cylance ] says : “Interpol , God love them , I know a lot of guys there try really hard , but there are no universal laws , no Geneva pact for cyber war and engagement , no cross-boundary or nation laws .
8078	4	There probably needs to be a 100-fold increase in what law enforcement authorities are doing .
8078	5	They just don’t have the bandwidth , the resources , to do that .”Enjoy
8078	6	the reading , and have a great day !David June 5 , 2014 3:36 pm High-profile hacking raises cyber security fears By Hannah KuchlerAuthor alerts The dark world of cyber crime is slowly being prised open , as threats rise to levels where companies and individuals are forced to treat the matter as of critical importance .Large scale attacks on retailers including international online marketplace eBay and Target , the US chain , have made everyone from executives to shoppers more aware of the threat hackers pose to the online world.Long spoken of in hushed tones , cyber warfare now finds itself plastered on FBI “Wanted ” posters .
8078	7	The US in May brought criminal charges against five of China ’s military officers for cyber crime .Law enforcement authorities are grappling with a complex online threat that knows no national borders .
8078	8	In some simpler cases , they have found real-life doors to break down to arrest cyber criminals.Lee Weiner , senior vice-president of products and engineering at Rapid 7 , IT security data specialists in Boston , Massachusetts , says companies are increasing their investment in cyber security in the face of “outstanding ” economics for cyber criminals , the majority of whom are motivated by the money they can make .“The
8078	9	awareness of cyber crime has definitely increased because of the severity and frequency of attacks , ” he says .
8078	10	“It is more of a boardroom topic now , which hopefully will let companies allocate greater budgets to it .”The
8078	11	number of companies reporting concerns about cyber security to US regulators more than doubled in the past two years to 1,174 , according to official data .
8078	12	Commercial bankers and oil and gas producers were among those most worried about attacks .The theft of millions of items of customer data – including credit card details and passwords – is a relatively easy issue to understand compared with the complex world of cyber espionage , nation state actors and illicit markets in intellectual property .The Target and eBay attacks reverberated through boardrooms across the world .
8078	13	Directors watched closely as Target’s chief executive resigned , with under-investment in security seen as partly to blame.Cyber attacks have wreaked damage on companies for years , but their cost has often been hard to calculate .
8078	14	In the Target case , customers took flight and earnings suffered .
8078	15	“ Target definitely helped with the wake up call because of the timing , the magnitude and the subsequent impact to the business , including the chief executive , ” says Mr Weiner.The impact of the hack on eBay , announced in May , is not clear .
8078	16	A cyber criminal penetrated eBay’s network using employee credentials and stole encrypted passwords and personal details such as addresses and birth dates .
8078	17	Some cyber security experts question how a hacker was able to access the full customer database .
8078	18	Others suggest that eBay – perhaps surprisingly for a company that owns online payment system PayPal – did not have the most advanced encryption levels . In the China case , Washington has surprised many with its public warning to Beijing .
8078	19	The justice department alleged that the officers hacked into the computer systems of five US steel companies and a labour union to steal secrets .
8078	20	Eric Holder , attorney-general , pointed to a unit of the People’s Liberation Army in Shanghai .
8078	21	Previously , the US government has tended to speak in broad terms about cyber threats .
8078	22	Unusually , he named the companies that had been the victims of the alleged intellectual property theft.The Wanted posters raised awareness of a threat but the chance of arresting the officers or halting any cyber espionage programme is slim .
8078	23	China hit back , calling the US a “high-level hooligan” , and announced a new security screening process for foreign IT products and services.Cyber criminals in the US face heightened attention from law enforcers .
8078	24	In May , the FBI arrested hackers who allegedly used a “sophisticated and pernicious ” form of malware .
8078	25	At $ 40 , the Blackshade remote access tool , says Preetinder Bharara , US Attorney for the Southern District of New York working on the case , is “inexpensive and simple to use ” but with “breathtaking ” invasiveness , including the ability to spy on people using their web cameras and log their keystrokes.The FBI were able to arrest Brendan Johnston , who was allegedly paid to help sell malware including Blackshade , and two people alleged to have bought the software and used it to steal online account information. In a rare victory for cross-border cyber crime co-operation , Alex Yucel , alleged co-developer and head of a group selling Blackshade , was arrested in Moldova last year and awaits extradition to the US.These moves are the first steps of a fightback against a still growing threat .
8078	26	Stuart McClure , founder of cyber security company Cylance , says the very definition of a cyber criminal has changed in recent years : “It used to be kids in the basement , then it moved to organised groups such as Anonymous [the hacking activist association ] in the early stage , then more organised crime , targeted espionage and then nation states .”Protections
8078	27	against hackers remain conspicuously weak , what with security software that turns out to be hugely flawed and a skills shortage that makes cyber security specialists too expensive for many companies and state and local governments to hire .The discovery of the “ Heartbleed ” bug in April highlighted quite how under-resourced cyber security has been .
8078	28	The flaw in Open SSL , better known as the software behind the little padlock image that indicates a web page is secure , left two-thirds of the world’s websites vulnerable to cyber attack . Hackers were able to exploit the flaw to request anything in a computer’s short term memory , from passwords to data such as social security numbers stolen from Canada’s tax authority .Open SSL , a vital plank of security , which was even used by large technology companies including Google and Yahoo , was severely underfunded and maintained by the equivalent of just two full time software engineers .
8078	29	The project to develop Open SSL was set up in the late 1990s as a non-profit foundation .
8078	30	It received less than $ 2,000 in donations a year until the flaw was unearthed , prompting the tech industry to pledge almost $ 3m to secure the software and other core infrastructure .The shortage of cyber security skills makes defence difficult even for organisations with larger budgets .
8078	31	In the US , 200,000 software security positions are unfilled , with a particular shortage of experts in network security , according to the Boston Consulting Group.The targets rich with confidential data that can be sold on the thriving black market are not necessarily those able to lure the best security engineers .
8078	32	State and local government , universities and small businesses , for example , struggle to recruit the talent they need.Law enforcement sorely lacks an international framework to help with cross-border investigations and prosecutions .
8078	33	Mr McClure says : “Interpol , God love them , I know a lot of guys there try really hard , but there are no universal laws , no Geneva pact for cyber war and engagement , no cross-boundary or nation laws .“There
8078	34	probably needs to be a 100-fold increase in what law enforcement authorities are doing .
8078	35	They just don’t have the bandwidth , the resources , to do that . ”

10051	407	SEP-2013 | RCS 9 | 2013© HT S.r.l . - pag . 33 Tip : a configuration can be saved as a template to load it the next time you create a similar agent .
10051	408	Tip : a factory can be used to create several agents : for example , to be installed via different installation vectors ( i .e . : two computers with different operating systems ) .
10051	409	How to create factories Factories are templates that can be created on two different operation-target-agent hierarchical levels : l on the operation level : the factory , after installation and first synchronization , auto- matically creates an agent and target for each device l on the target level : the factory , after installation and first synchronization , automatically creates an agent for that target The operation level mode ensure that collected evidence is assigned separately .
10051	410	In fact , it creates as many agents as there are devices .
10051	411	Later , if two or more devices belong to the same target , the agent can be moved to the right target .
10051	412	The target level mode , if incorrectly used , may create a factory which is used to create several agents .
10051	413	Installation vectors Installation vectors are selected when compiling and define the installation method , physical or remote , for an agent .
10051	414	When compiling , available installation vectors may vary according to the device 's operating system .
10051	415	Several installation vectors can be used for the same agent .
10051	416	NOTE : injection rules are used for injection on HTTP connections .See " Managing the Network Injector " on page 67 Agents An agent is the result of compiling a factory with one or more installation vectors .
10051	417	An agent is ready to be installed on a device .
10051	418	Basic configuration defines the type of data to be acquired while advanced configuration lets you dynamically and independently activate or deactivate modules .
10051	419	For the types of modules available in basic and advanced configurations see " Module list " on page 122 For more information on agents see " What you should know about agents " on page 39 .
10051	420	Data acquisition modules Modules trigger some activities on the target device , mainly data acquisition .
10051	421	They are enabled and set in the basic configuration ( only some ) or in advanced configuration .
10051	422	Available module types also depend on the device type .

10051	439	SEP-2013 | RCS 9 | 2013© HT S.r.l . - pag . 37 5 Agents Presentation Introduction Agents acquire data from the device on which they are installed and send it to the RCS Collectors .
10051	440	Their configuration and software can be updated and they can transfer files unnoticed to the target .
10051	441	Content This section includes the following topics : What you should know about agents 39 Agent page 41 Agent configuration log data 43 Agent event log data 44 Agent synchronization log data 44 Command page 44 Transferring files to/from a target 46 Technician 's Guide ver.1.5
10051	442	SEP-2013 - RCS 9 - 2013© HT S.r.l . - pag . 38 What you should know about agents Agent installation The agent can be exposed and identified if installed in environments with antivirus or in environments managed by expert technicians .
10051	443	To prevent this from happening , a substitute , the scout agent , is sent at installation to infect the target device and check the environment .
10051	444	Once installed , the scout agent appears in the target page after the first synchronization .
10051	445	Its icon , similar to the agent one , indicates the platform where it is installed .
10051	446	For example : l : scout agent installed on a Windows device l : scout agent installed on a BlackBerry device Evidence acquisition for installation environment analysis After installation is completed , the scout agent acquires evidence : l Screenshot type to help identify the target device l Device type to help understand whether the environment to be infected is ok or whether there are applications that could compromise agent integrity .
10051	447	IMPORTANT : Screenshot type evidence is only collected if the module is enabled in the configuration .
10051	448	If necessary , remember to enable it before sending the agent .
10051	449	Installation environment analysis After the scout agent acquires evidence , it must be checked to decide whether the installation environment is safe for the agent .
10051	450	If the environment is safe , the agent can be updated ; the scout agent is replaced by the agent .
10051	451	If the environment is not safe , the scout agent must be closed .
10051	452	Updating the scout agent Updating the scout agent installs the agent and the scout agent icon is replaced by the agent icon in the target page .
10051	453	l : agent installed on a Windows device l : agent installed on a BlackBerry device RCS 9 -What you should know about agents Technician 's Guide | ver.1.5
10051	454	SEP-2013 | RCS 9 | 2013© HT S.r.l . - pag . 39 Agent synchronization An agent will perform synchronization only if : l synchronization is enabled in the basic configuration l a Synchronize type action was added to the advanced configuration .
10051	455	Offline and online agents An agent behaves differently according to the Internet connection availability : If the Inter- net con- nection is ... Then ... not avail- able if the agent has modules enabled , it starts to record data in the device .
10051	456	available if first synchronization has been run on the agent , you can : l change settings , for example , as recording requests become more specific for that device .
10051	457	Resetting an agent does not change factory settings l update its software , l transfer files to and from the device , l analyze sent evidence Tip : start creating an agent and only enable synchronization and the device module .
10051	458	Then , once installed , and upon receiving the first synchronization , gradually enable the other modules , according to the device capabilities and the type of evidence you want to collect .
10051	459	Temporarily disabling an agent Agent activities can be temporarily suspended without uninstalling the agent by simply disabling all the modules and leaving only synchronization active .
10051	460	Agent testing To test a configuration before production use , create an agent in Demo mode ( see " Compiling a factory " on page 35 ) .
10051	461	The agent is created in demo mode , behaving according to the given configuration , with the sole difference that it clearly signals its presence on the device ( with audio , led and screen messages ) .
10051	462	Signaling permits easy identification of an infected device used for testing .

10051	465	Agent configuration Agent configuration ( basic or advanced ) can be repeatedly edited .
10051	466	When saved , a copy of the configuration is created and saved in the configuration log .
10051	467	At the next synchronization , the agent will receive the new configuration ( Sent time ) and communicate successful installation ( Activated ) .
10051	468	From that point on , any changes can only be made by saving a new configuration .
10051	469	NOTE : If Sent time and Activated are null , the current settings can still be edited .

10051	554	SEP-2013 - RCS 9 - 2013© HT S.r.l . - pag . 49 What you should know about basic configuration Basic configuration The basic factory/agent configuration let you enable and quickly set evidence acquisition .
10051	555	Basic configuration does not include the acquisition of some types of evidence nor detailed acquisition method options .
10051	556	Default basic configuration : l System information acquisition when the device is turned on ( cannot be disabled ) l A module to run synchronization between the agent and RCS at a certain interval .
10051	557	For the list of module types available in the basic configuration see " Basic configuration data " on page 53 .
10051	558	CAUTION : when returning from advanced configuration to basic configuration , the advanced configuration will be lost and the default basic configuration will be restored .
10051	559	Exporting and importing configuration settings Base or advanced configuration settings are exported/imported to reuse the settings on other RCS systems .
10051	560	The base or advanced configuration settings are exported in a .json
10051	561	file that can be transferred to another system and imported when creating an agent .
10051	562	Saving the configuration settings as a template Base or advanced configurations settings are saved as a template to have other users on the same RCS system reuse the configuration .
10051	563	The base or advanced configuration settings are saved as a template in the database , accompanied by a description and the name of the user .
10051	564	When creating another target , another user can load it and thus it becomes the configuration for that agent .
10051	565	IMPORTANT : base and advanced configuration templates are saved separately in the database .
10051	566	Base configuration templates thus appear when creating an agent with a base configuration , advanced configuration templates appear when creating an agent with an advanced configuration .

9538	49	iii Preface The U.S. military exists not just to fight and win wars but also to deter them and even dissuade others from preparing for them .
9538	50	Deterrence is possible only when others have a good idea of what the U.S. military can do .
9538	51	Such acknowledgment is at the heart of U.S. nuclear deterrence strategy and , to a lesser extent , our maintaining strong mobile conventional forces that can intervene almost anywhere on the globe .
9538	52	Cyberattack capabilities , however , resist such demon - stration , for many reasons , not least of which is that their effects are very specific to details of a target system’s software , architecture , and management .
9538	53	But the fact that cyberattack capabili- ties cannot easily be used to shape the behavior of others does not mean they cannot be used at all .
9538	54	This report explores ways that cyberattack capabilities can be “brandished . ”
9538	55	It then goes on to examine the obstacles to doing so and sketches some realistic limits on our expectations .

9538	76	31 vii Summary Background and Purpose The U.S. military exists not just to fight and win wars but also to deter them , that is , to persuade others not to start them ( or even prepare for them ) .
9538	77	Deterrence is possible only when others know or at least have good indications of what the U.S. military can do .
9538	78	Such acknowledgment is at the heart of U.S. nuclear deterrence strategy and , to a lesser extent , the U.S. maintaining strong mobile conventional forces that can intervene almost anywhere on the globe .
9538	79	Cyberattack capabilities resist such demonstration .
9538	80	No one knows exactly or even approx - imately what would happen if a country suffered a full-fledged cyberattack , despite the pleth - ora of hostile activity in cyberspace .
9538	81	For one thing , there has never been a cyberwar—attacks with destruction and casualties comparable to physical war .
9538	82	Theory also works against dem - onstration .
9538	83	Flaws in target systems enable cyberattacks .
9538	84	To reveal which flaws enable attack is to inform others how to fix the flaws and hence neutralize them .
9538	85	It is no wonder that national cyberwar capabilities are a closely guarded secret .
9538	86	That cyberattack capabilities cannot easily be used to shape the behavior of others does not mean they cannot be used at all .
9538	87	This report explores ways that cyberattack capabilities can be “brandished ” and the circumstances under which some deterrence effect can be achieved .1
9538	88	It then goes on to examine the obstacles to realizing such achievement and sketches out some realistic limits on the expectations .
9538	89	As a matter of policy , the United States has never said that it would use cyberattacks , but neither has it said that it would not .
9538	90	It has also not vigorously disputed the notion that it had some hand in the Stuxnet attacks on the Iranian nuclear facility .
9538	91	The Broad Effects of Brandishing Cyber Capabilities Any state that would discourage other states from aggression in the physical or cyber world by brandishing cyberattack capabilities should first ask itself whether the point of doing so is to look powerful or to make others look powerless .
9538	92	Although both aims are useful , the need to concentrate on one message in a strategic communications campaign suggests the usefulness of making a choice .
9538	93	Emphasizing one’s power has the advantage of inducing caution in all actual or potential opponents and deflects predators to easier prey .
9538	94	It may also reflect well on other 1 Note that the usage of brandishing here is intended to invoke the imagery of warriors displaying their weapons ( and hence their capabilities ) before battle , by way of warning , rather than that of a criminal displaying a gun to threaten a victim .
9538	95	viii Brandishing Cyberattack Capabilities sources of national power .
9538	96	But trumpeting the weaknesses of others deters troublesome states by reminding them of their vulnerabilities .
9538	97	It also deflects the accusations of self-promotion by turning the focus toward potential victims .
9538	98	A bigger challenge is how to demonstrate cyberwar capabilities .
9538	99	The most obvious way to demonstrate the ability to hack into an enemy’s system is to actually do it , leave a calling card , and hope it is passed forward to national decisionmakers .
9538	100	If the attack can be repeated at will or if the penetration can be made persistent , the target will be forced to believe in the attacker’s ability to pop into his system at any time .
9538	101	This should force the target to recalculate its correla - tion of forces against the attacker .
9538	102	But as with many things in cyberspace , it sounds simpler than it is .
9538	103	Hinting at outright success is difficult without conceding one’s participation in mischief in the first place and hence cyberwar’s legitimacy as a tool of statecraft , something countries only started acknowl - edging in mid-2012 .
9538	104	Targets of little value tend to be easy , but penetrating them is unimpres - sive .
9538	105	Targets of some value are , for that reason , much harder , often because they are electroni- cally isolated .
9538	106	Finally , the ability to penetrate a system does not necessarily prove the ability to break a system .
9538	107	The latter requires not only breaking into sufficiently privileged levels but also figuring out how to induce a system to fail and keep on failing .
9538	108	But penetration may be suf - ficiently scary in itself if the target leadership cannot discern the difference between breaking into and breaking .
9538	109	Breaking a system is more hostile and more difficult than breaking into one .
9538	110	It requires an understanding of what makes the system fail .
9538	111	Getting the desired results also requires shap - ing the attack so that those who administer the system cannot detect the attack and repair the damage quickly .
9538	112	Conveying to others the ability to bring their systems down and keep them down is not easy .
9538	113	Intended audiences of such demonstrations may subsequently identify the flaw that would allow such an attack and fix it .
9538	114	If so , for brandishing to work , cyberattack capabilities may require repeated demonstration .
9538	115	Alternatively , a less hostile demonstration could be to manipulate the system but not to the point of harming it , a fine line .
9538	116	Can brandishing help dissuade other states from pursuing a network-centric high - technology force to counter U.S. military capabilities ?
9538	117	The best way to demonstrate the risk of network-centricity is to hack into military systems to show their fragility ( claiming responsibil- ity is unnecessary ; the point is to emphasize not U.S. power but the vulnerability of the ene - my’s network-centric systems ) .
9538	118	In other circumstances , making what is vulnerable clear may be unnecessary , perhaps unwise .
9538	119	Every hack leads to fixes that make the next exploitation much harder .
9538	120	But the hint of an attack that leaves no specific trace leaves nothing specific to fix .
9538	121	The point is to convince others that they cannot protect their systems even after paying close atten- tion to their security .
9538	122	The vulnerability of less sophisticated states to unseen manipulation may be higher when the target does not really understand the technology behind its own weapon systems .
9538	123	Often , the target’s lack of access to others ’ source code and not having built any of its own complicates figuring out what went wrong and how to fix it .
9538	124	Not all states will throw up their hands , though .
9538	125	Some may reason that , because the effects of cyberattacks are temporary and difficult , their systems can survive the initial exchange and recover for subsequent rounds .
9538	126	So , they pursue high technology and ignore the demonstrated possibility that high-technology military campaigns might last days rather than months or years .
9538	127	A subtler counterstrategy is to network warfighting machines ( configured not to touch the Internet ) and forget about networking people ; isolation avoids some of the pesky vulner- abilities arising from human error ( notably those associated with authentication , such as pass - Summary ix words and tokens ) .
9538	128	Or they simply renounce network-centric warfare and conclude that they avoided the pitfalls of depending on technology .
9538	129	It is unclear whether brandishing cyberattack capabilities can curb the enthusiasm of potential foes for war .
9538	130	Some states may feel they have little choice .
9538	131	Others may feel that they can succeed even if their high-technology systems fail .
9538	132	Yet others may discount the possibil- ity entirely , believing their systems—when called on for war—would be disconnected from the rest of the world .
9538	133	Last , the target may simply not believe its own vulnerability , not during peacetime and certainly not when the war drums sound .
9538	134	Going to war requires surmounting a great many fears ; digital ghosts may simply be another .
9538	135	The unwanted effects of making even some third parties believe that we have invaded their systems warrants note .
9538	136	All other militaries may also shy away from foreign sources for logic - processing devices ( whether software or hardware ) and may redouble their efforts to increase their indigenous production capability or , alternatively , pressure their suppliers to hand over source code with their systems , a negative if their supplier is a U.S. corporation .
9538	137	The problem does not go away if the threat turns out not to work .
9538	138	Countries certain that their military systems have been invaded may blame the United States for any military failures even with no evidence of U.S. involvement .
9538	139	Conversely , the United States may be accused of complicity with a rogue state whenever its equipment does not fail because this could only mean that the United States condoned the rogue’s actions .
9538	140	Brandishing Cyberattack Capabilities in a Nuclear Confrontation Are there circumstances in which the United States might usefully hint that it could interfere with a rogue state’s nuclear weapons and thereby defuse a nuclear confrontation ?
9538	141	Posit a rogue state with dozens of weapons capable of hurting neighbors but not the United States .
9538	142	Assume further the United States has a robust cyberwar capability from which the rogue state’s nuclear arsenal is not provably immune .
9538	143	To the extent that the rogue state is far more willing to go to the brink than the United States is , it may not be completely deterred by the U.S. promise of a devastating reaction to its nuclear use .
9538	144	The rogue nuclear state , we further posit , threatens that , if the United States crosses its “red line , ” it could or would respond with a nuclear shot .
9538	145	We first model a two-state confrontation and then introduce a friendly third state on whose behalf the United States is acting .
9538	146	The question is , which is more implacable : the United States determined to cross the red line or the rogue state equally determined to respond with nuclear weapons ?
9538	147	If one side can communicate enough confidence in its willingness to keep pressing , the other side may feel that the first side will not back down and would thus logically recognize that the choice is between yielding and catastrophe .
9538	148	The more that the other side indicates it might yield , the greater the impetus for the first side to stand firm , making it seem even more implacable to the other side .
9538	149	The purpose of brandishing a cyberwar weapon is to threaten the other side’s ability use its nuclear capability in a crisis .
9538	150	This purpose is less to make the other side doubt its own nuclear capability—although that can help—but to project a belief that the United States will press on either because the rogue state’s weapons will not work or because the rogue state will respond to the brandisher’s confidence (underwritten , of course , by its deterrence capability ) and back down .
9538	151	Note that the logic works even if the target state believes that the brandisher’s x Brandishing Cyberattack Capabilities confidence has no basis in reality ( i .e . , its own nuclear command and control is rock solid ) .
9538	152	The rogue state needs only to believe that the brandisher believes it can act with impunity to conclude that the choice is between disaster and backing down .
9538	153	To be sure , because a cyber- war capability cannot be tested in the same way that an antimissile capability can be tested , the rogue state may conclude that the brandisher’s confidence is unwarranted and therefore that such confidence should not exist and hence does not exist .
9538	154	But that could also be wishful thinking on the rogue state’s part .
9538	155	If brandishing a cyberthreat created a use-it-or-lose-it dilemma for the rogue state lead- ing to nuclear use , brandishing could backfire on the United States .
9538	156	But it should not , largely because it is not a threat of what will happen but what has already happened : The flaw has already been exploited .
9538	157	However , brandishing a cyberwar capability , particularly if specific , makes it harder to use such a capability because brandishing is likely to persuade the target to redouble its efforts either to find or route around the exploited flaw ( the one that enabled the United States to neutralize its nuclear threat ) .
9538	158	Brandishing capabilities sacrifices the ability to manage a war in exchange for the ability to manage a crisis .
9538	159	One possible component of the brandishing process is to convey that a nuclear shot that failed will be noticed—and responded to—even if the failure would be invisible to outside observers .
9538	160	Otherwise , the rogue state may reason that failure is costless and that success , while potentially very costly , at least demonstrates that the rogue state is serious .
9538	161	But if the induced failure is not obvious ( e .g. , the button is pushed and nothing happens ) , can the United States retaliate against an attempted action that only the United States saw ?
9538	162	Once third parties are in a position to veto U.S. military actions , they can complicate the use of brandishing .
9538	163	Although third parties may have greater animus against the nuclear-armed state and , correspondingly , a greater willingness to see it humiliated , and certainly deterred , they may well blanch at the cyberwar-backed bluff .
9538	164	First , they and their citizens are likely to be at greater risk by dint of sitting within range of the rogue state’s nuclear weapons .
9538	165	Second , they would know little about U.S. cyberwar capabilities and may thus have less confidence that such capabilities would work than the United States ( supposedly ) has .
9538	166	The rogue state may figure that it need not stare down the United States if it can scare the third party whose concurrence is needed for U.S. actions .
9538	167	The United States may need options to convince the third party that it can stand fast because , among other things , its cyberwar capabilities will neutralize the nuclear threat .
9538	168	It could say , “trust me on this ” or else .
9538	169	But a U.S. response that goes beyond asking for trust may have to reveal much more about the details of U.S. cyberwar capabilities than the United States seems comfortable doing today .
9538	170	A crisis makes revelation problematic : Even though steadfast- ness requires pro-U.S. forces to project faith in the U.S. ability to nullify a nuclear threat , those nervous of taking such a huge risk , skeptics of cyberwar’s power , or opponents of the United States within the government have every incentive to cast doubt on the proposition or even leak the information entrusted to them .
9538	171	( Incidentally , a similar logic applies if the friendly third party is domestic , such as the U.S. Congress , opinion makers , and the public . )
9538	172	It may be to the rogue state’s advantage to imply that cyberwar capabilities ( rather than the confidence in the deterrence effect of its nuclear weapons ) are the primary basis for the firm stance the United States has adopted .
9538	173	This could pressure the United States to demonstrate what it can do .
9538	174	Summary xi Conclusions Brandishing a cyberattack capability would do three things : declare a capability , suggest the possibility of its use in a particular circumstance , and indicate that such use would really hurt .
9538	175	In the era of the U.S.-Soviet nuclear standoff , the suggestion of use was the most relevant .
9538	176	Possession was obvious , and its consequences were well understood .
9538	177	The same does not hold true for cyberweapons .
9538	178	Possession is likely not obvious , and the ability to inflict serious harm is debatable .
9538	179	Even if demonstrated , what worked yesterday may not work today .
9538	180	But difficult does not mean impossible .
9538	181	Advertising cyberwar capabilities may be helpful .
9538	182	It may back up a deterrence strategy .
9538	183	It might dissuade other states from conventional mischief or even from investing in mischief - making capabilities .
9538	184	It may reduce the other side’s confidence in the reliability of its informa - tion , command and control , or weapon systems .
9538	185	In a nuclear confrontation , it may help build the edge that persuades other states that the brandisher will stay the course , thereby persuading them to yield .
9538	186	Yet proving such capability is not easy , even if it exists .
9538	187	Cyber capabilities exist only in relationship to a specific target , which must be scoped to be understood .
9538	188	Cyber warriors can illustrate their ability to penetrate systems , but penetration is not the same as getting them to fail in useful ways .
9538	189	Since cyberattacks are essentially single-use weapons , they are diminished in the showing .
9538	190	It can be hard to persuade your friends that you have such capabilities when skepticism is in their interest .
9538	191	Furthermore , brandishing may backfire .
9538	192	Touting an ability to strike back in cyberspace may communicate a tendency to shy from violence .
9538	193	Claiming the power to alter reality may convince others to blame the claimant when reality is disagreeable .
9538	194	Interfering with others ’ command and control may allow them to justify rules of engagement that abdicate their own responsibility over subordinates .
9538	195	And asserting an ability to nullify opposing nuclear systems may spur them to call what they perceive as a bluff .
9538	196	Should the United States put the world on notice that it has cyber capabilities and knows how to use them ?
9538	197	The wisdom of that course is not obvious .
9538	198	Evidence is scant that others act because they do not believe the United States has or can develop cyber capabilities .
9538	199	Conversely , the gains from brandishing such capabilities depend on the context and can be problematic even then .
9538	200	There is both promise and risk in cyber brandishing , in both the conventional and nuclear cases .
9538	201	It would not hurt to give serious thought to ways in which the United States can enhance its ability to leverage what others believe are national capabilities .
9538	202	Stuxnet has certainly con- vinced many others that the United States can do many sophisticated things in cyberspace ( regardless of what , if anything , the United States actually contributed to Stuxnet ) .
9538	203	This effort will take considerable analysis and imagination , inasmuch as none of the various options pre - sented here are obvious winners .
9538	204	That said , brandishing is an option that may also not work .
9538	205	It is no panacea , and it is unlikely to make a deterrence posture succeed if the other elements of deterrence ( e .g. , the will to wage war or , for red lines drawn in cyberspace , the ability to attribute ) are weak .
9538	206	xiii Acknowledgments The author would like to acknowledge the valuable contribution to the analysis contained in this report made by Roger C. Molander , who passed away on March 25 , 2012 .
9538	207	Dr. Molan- der spent a full career working to analyze and illuminate the complex dimensions of strategic nuclear deterrence .
9538	208	More recently , he had applied the same analytic rigor to questions raised by cyber operations , particularly the interaction of technical and operational factors with political incentives .
9538	209	He made innovative contributions to understanding the difficult questions posed by large nuclear weapons holdings and by powerful cyber operations capabilities .
9538	210	The latter formed an important part of the intellectual foundation for the material presented in this report , notably Chapter Three , which arose from conversations he initiated .
9538	211	The author also acknowledges the generously provided and very useful commentary from Stuart Johnson , James Dobbins , Forrest Morgan , and the formal reviews of David C. Gompert and James T. Quinlivan .
9538	212	Finally , the U.S. Naval War College sponsored production of an early version of the material in Chapter Two . 1 Chapter One No May Day Parades Background and Purpose Marching warfighters and weaponry down urban thoroughfares has been a time-honored way for states to hint at their ability to carry out war .
9538	213	Cyberwar capabilities , to be sure , resist such presentation .
9538	214	Cadres of computer geeks advancing with laptops in their rucksacks somehow do not inspire the same awe .
9538	215	The inability to display power points to a larger dilemma of cyberwar .
9538	216	The U.S. military exists not just to fight and win wars but also to deter them , that is , to persuade others not to start them ( or even prepare for them ) .
9538	217	To do this , it helps to demonstrate that the U.S. military is and always will be likely to ruin those who would fight it—whether the ruin be a crushed military or a damaged society .
9538	218	By so doing , the United States may hope to deter others from attacking it or its vital interests —either kinetically or via cyberspace .
9538	219	It may even hope to dis - suade states from developing digitized capabilities that are particularly vulnerable to cyberat- tack .
9538	220	Although May Day parades are a bit of a caricature , a state would rationally examine the ability of its potential adversaries before pursuing its politicomilitary strategies .
9538	221	But cyberwar capabilities are hard to examine .
9538	222	Why so ?
9538	223	No one doubts what would happen if a nuclear-armed power dropped its big weapon on a city , even though no city has been hit by a nuclear bomb since 1945 .
9538	224	The phys - ics are clear , and they work anywhere .
9538	225	But no one knows exactly or even approximately what would happen if a country suffered a full-fledged cyberattack , despite the plethora of hostile activity in cyberspace that shows no signs of abating .
9538	226	For one thing , there has never been such an attack .
9538	227	Theory also discourages good a priori expectations .
9538	228	First , systems are vulnerable only to the extent that they have exploitable errors that their owners do not know about or have simply ignored .
9538	229	Second , even if a cyberattack works , the damage it wreaks tends to be proportional to the time required to recover the attacked system , something neither the defender nor the attacker can easily predict .
9538	230	Third , national cyberwar capabilities are a closely guarded secret .
9538	231	Having spent much time and trouble developing cyberwar capabilities , states thus have nothing to show for their efforts until and unless they go to cyberwar .
9538	232	Although some of the capabilities needed for cyberwar are the same ones used for cyberespionage , some are not .
9538	233	Bringing systems down requires effort to understand their failure modes ; keeping them down requires being able to insert code into the target networks and system in ways that make it dif - ficult to eradicate .
9538	234	Furthermore , systems targeted by espionage ( e .g. , email networks ) are very different from the harder systems that run critical infrastructure or war machines .
9538	235	2 Brandishing Cyberattack Capabilities That cyberattack capabilities cannot easily and credibly be brandished does not mean they cannot be brandished at all .
9538	236	This report explores ways that cyberwar capabilities can be so used , obstacles to doing so well , some uses of doing so , some risks involved , and limits on our expectations .
9538	237	What Is Brandishing ?
9538	238	Brandishing a weapon communicates what it is and suggests how it would be used .1 Brandish - ing can be implicit , leaving it to others to determine the implications of its use .
9538	239	Or it can be explicit , with the owner choosing the context and timing for signaling something .2
9538	240	Capabilities are generally brandished to shape or at least reinforce other states ’ estimates of the risks they face by opposing the brandisher .
9538	241	For cyberspace , estimates vary greatly .
9538	242	Cyber- attack capabilities are always capabilities against specific systems , and states vary in what sys - tems they have , how important they are , and how secure they are .
9538	243	Because no state where news about Stuxnet has penetrated can seriously believe the United States lacks offensive cyberattack capabilities and because so many argue for the pri- macy of offense therein,3 U.S. cyberwar capabilities may already be discouraging others from mischief today .4
9538	244	Weapons alone can do this .
9538	245	In 1932 ( before Germany had a Luftwaffe ) , Stanley Baldwin persuaded the British Parliament not to intervene too hastily in European affairs by arguing that a serious adversary could use airpower to do great damage to Great Britain : “The bomber will always get through .”5
9538	246	Why brandish cyberattack capabilities at all ? • One reason is simply to make a threat , either specifically ( “do this and we will carry out a cyberattack” ) or generally ( “do this , and we will respond—with capabilities that include a possible cyberattack” ) . 1 Note that the usage of brandishing here is intended to invoke the imagery of warriors displaying their weapons ( and hence their capabilities ) before battle , by way of warning , rather than that of a criminal displaying a gun to threaten a victim . 2 The explicitness of the threat does not necessarily conform to how openly a capability is declared .
9538	247	It is possible to be very open about having a capability without drawing red lines .
9538	248	( A red line is a limit a state establishes beyond which it feels obliged to take action . )
9538	249	With somewhat more difficulty , one can make an explicit threat based on a coyly presented capability .
9538	250	3 Among the many sources that argue that offense is dominant in cyberspace are Jonathan Masters , “Confronting the Cyber Threat , ” New York : Council on Foreign Relations , May 23 , 2011 ; Richard J. Harknett , John P. Callaghan , and Rudi Kauffman , “Leaving Deterrence Behind : War-Fighting and National Cybersecurity , ” Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management , Vol . 7 , No. 1 , November 11 , 2010 ; and Eric Sterner , “Stuxnet and the Pentagon’s Cyber Strategy , ” Arlington , Va. : George C. Marshall Institute , October 13 , 2010 .
9538	251	4 Nevertheless , when asked whether the United States had ever “‘demonstrated capabilities ’ in cyberspace in a way that would lead to deterrence of potential adversaries , ” General Alexander responded , “Not in any significant way . ”
9538	252	Keith Alex - ander , “Advance Questions for Lieutenant General Keith Alexander , USA , Nominee for Commander , United States Cyber Command , ” statement to the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services , April 15 , 2010 , p . 21 . 5 George H. Quester , Deterrence Before Hiroshima , Piscataway , N.J. : Transaction Publishers , 1986 .
9538	253	Note that Baldwin was speaking over a dozen years and many generations of aircraft after the last use of airpower against a sophisticated foe .
9538	254	Yet as the Battle of Britain later proved , once countries faced real bombers , damage was less than feared , and they did not always get through .
9538	255	no May Day parades 3 • Another is to counter a threat , whether explicit or implicit .
9538	256	This is similar to announcing a capability for ballistic missile defense after the other side has announced a ballistic mis - sile capability—with cyberwar playing the role of a weapon aimed at the missile’s com- mand and control .
9538	257	Such an announcement may be made to downplay the threat , assuring oneself and allies and thereby weakening the threat’s deterrent power .
9538	258	If the underlying threat is itself a counterdeterrent ( “if you launch a missile , we will launch one back” ) , the cyberattack capability can be brandished to reinforce the original deterrent ( “yes , but your missile will fail , and so we will ignore your threat” ) .
9538	259	Such brandishing helps project confidence .
9538	260	• Brandishing a cyberattack capability can warn others against pursuing capabilities that depend on digital systems in general and networks in particular .
9538	261	A variant of that threat is to hint that the information that potential foes use to make operational or even strate- gic decisions may be corrupted and is therefore unreliable .
9538	262	The threat need not be proac - tive ( “if you do this . . .
9538	263	” ) ; the brandisher can hint that a corruption attack has already reached its target , meaning that even existing data cannot be trusted .
9538	264	The credibility of the cyberattack threat will depend on a state’s track record in cyberspace coupled with its general reputation at military technology and the likelihood that it would use such capabilities when called on .
9538	265	Finally , as the technologies of cyberspace and the targeted state’s dependence on cyberspace evolve , so too will the effectiveness of such threats .
9538	266	Brandishing and Deterrence : A Cautionary Note One reason for a state to say or hint that it has offensive cyberwar capabilities is to give teeth to a deterrence policy .6
9538	267	As a general rule , the greater a state’s capabilities to strike , the greater the consequences of other states of crossing the lines it lays down , and thus the lower the likeli- hood that other states will cross the lines ( at least up to the point at which other states fear for their sovereignty and try to cut the state down to size because it is so threatening ) .
9538	268	That noted , deterrence also requires some clarity on where the red lines are and how willing such a state is to carry out its threat and by what means .
9538	269	Absent such clarity , brandishing may have an effect opposite from the one intended .
9538	270	Much depends , therefore , on what other states conclude about the motive for brandishing a cyberwar capability and the timing of the brandishing .
9538	271	If the threatening state is explicit that it will use cyber means to retaliate for crossing certain red lines ( presumably , but not neces - sarily , in cyberspace ) , the role of brandishing is fairly clear : to give substance to a threat .
9538	272	But the timing may raise questions , especially if other states do not learn anything new about the threatening state’s capabilities ( which they always assumed existed ) but were uncertain about why the threatening state believed the point had to be made explicit .
9538	273	Context would matter .
9538	274	Brandishing a capability to reinforce a threat that has just been made ( or a red line that has just been laid down or redrawn ) may raise a few questions of timing , but brandishing a capability out of the blue might raise more .
9538	275	Some may view it as a bluff , an attempt to put a brave face 6 Consistent with the author’s previous report on deterrence ( Martin C. Libicki , Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar , Santa Monica , Calif. : RAND Corporation , MG-877-AF , 2009 ) , the word deterrence refers only to deterrence by punishment and does not include deterrence by denial .
9538	276	4 Brandishing Cyberattack Capabilities on the discovery that cyber capabilities are not impressing others for the good reason that they are not all that impressive .
9538	277	If the threatening state , however , has not stated or strongly hinted that its choice of retal- iatory weapon sits in cyberspace , other states may wonder why it is emphasizing its retaliatory capabilities in that domain .
9538	278	True , the answer may be innocent : A bureaucratic struggle may have been resolved , or a new cyberattack capability may be deemed mature .
9538	279	But states not privy to such explanations may conclude that brandishing a cyberattack capability was meant to signal that more violent responses are off the table .
9538	280	States that do not fear cyber capabilities ( maybe because their militaries or economies are not all that digitized ) may therefore conclude that they can relax and may therefore be less deterred .
9538	281	Organization of This Report With these cautions out of the way , the remainder of the report examines the consequences of brandishing cyberattack capabilities .
9538	282	I examine four separate goals for brandishing cyber- attack capabilities : to discourage military operations ; to dissuade countries from investing in network capabilities ; to permit the United States to face down nuclear-armed rogue states ; and to inhibit unprovoked nuclear aggression .
9538	283	Chapter Two is a general treatment of brandishing : whether and how states can prove or at least back up claims that they have such a capability and against whom , how it might be used to reduce the desire of other states to carry out operations or even invest in certain opera - tional capabilities , and the calculus and paradox of intimidation .
9538	284	Chapter Three specifically treats how cyberweapons may be brandished in a nuclear con- frontation .
9538	285	Clearly , when facing obliteration , the threat of being hacked is unlikely to register very high .
9538	286	However , the operational use of cyberwar to thwart an opponent’s nuclear com- mand-and-control cycle may play a more interesting role .
9538	287	Chapter Four wraps up the key insights .
9538	288	5 Chapter twO The Broad Effects of Brandishing Cyberattack Capabilities Brandishing a capability that cannot be displayed for inspection and cannot be demonstrated in any detail without rapidly nullifying it is more than a little challenging .
9538	289	In this chap - ter , I examine various ways of addressing the challenge , concluding that , while each has its merits , none is altogether satisfactory .
9538	290	In sequence , therefore , the chapter discusses how system penetration may allude to cyberattack capabilities , how the fear that penetration has already occurred may be created and sustained , and how fears of penetration may effect an adversary’s operational behavior or even its defense investments .
9538	291	It then examines some consequences of employing cyberattacks as a coercive device , discusses ways in which brandishing may backfire , and concludes by touching on current policies associated with the legitimization of cyberwar.1
9538	292	What Role for Brandishing ?
9538	293	Because the potential for cyberattacks arises from the target’s vulnerabilities coupled with the attacker’s ability to exploit them , is the desired effect of brandishing cyberattack capabilities to look powerful or to make the other side look powerless ?
9538	294	Of course , the answer could be both , and both may be useful , but if the brandishing is part of an overall strategic communications campaign , it may help to decide what to emphasize in such a campaign .
9538	295	Looking powerful is the more efficient option .
9538	296	It induces caution in actual or potential opponents .
9538	297	The demonstration does not have to be repeated for each one .
9538	298	Looking large also serves to deflect potential attackers away from one state toward others .
9538	299	Finally , there is glory in it ; success reflects well on other sources of national power .
9538	300	But concentrating instead on exposing another state’s weaknesses also has its virtues .
9538	301	It serves to deter troublesome states by reminding them of their vulnerabilities .
9538	302	It also deflects the accusations of self-promotion ( “look at how powerful I am” ) by turning the focus toward others .
9538	303	After all , a state shown to be vulnerable to one attacker in cyberspace may be presumed vulnerable to others .
9538	304	Even if the state retaliates , its systems will still be vulnerable and per- ceived as such .
9538	305	For the United States , a further goal may perhaps be to discourage attacks on anyone .
9538	306	In a globalized economy , a severe cyberattack against foreign institutions may hurt the United States in its pocketbook : directly , if the U.S. economy relies on their information services , and 1 An early version of the core argument of this chapter can be found in the author’s “Wringing Deterrence from Cyberwar Capabilities , ” in Richmond M. Lloyd , ed . , Economics and Security : Resourcing National Priorities , proceedings of a workshop sponsored by the William B. Ruger Chair of National Security Economics , Newport , R.I. : Naval War College , May 19–21 , 2010 , pp .
9538	307	259–272 .
9538	308	6 Brandishing Cyberattack Capabilities indirectly , through the effects on export prices and availability .
9538	309	Such an attack may have politi- cal ramifications .
9538	310	Cyberwar erodes trust ; successful attacks confound the rule of law .
9538	311	A posture to inhibit cyberwar in general , rather than just on the United States , fits with the current U.S. policy narrative that today’s security problems are the results of rogue action by rogue states .
9538	312	Would a Successful Penetration Say Enough About What Cyberwar Can Do ?
9538	313	The most obvious way of demonstrating the ability to hack into someone else’s system is to actually do it and leave a calling card ( e .g. , “Kilroy was here ” ) .
9538	314	The effect need not be obvi- ous to the public , but it must at least be obvious to system administrators .
9538	315	If the attack can be repeated at will or if the penetration can be made ineradicable , the target may be forced to believe that the perpetrator’s ability to pop into the target’s system at will is a fact .
9538	316	This forces the target to recalculate its correlation of forces against the perpetrator .
9538	317	This sounds simple .
9538	318	As with most things in cyberspace , it is not .
9538	319	The first problem is whether the calling card would be read and its existence transmitted to the leadership .
9538	320	If it is simply left for someone to stumble over , the answer may be “no . ”
9538	321	Ironically , the more pen- etrable the system is , the less astute its administrators are , all else being equal .
9538	322	Thus , the odds of having the penetration discovered and transmitted up the line go down .
9538	323	For this reason , any calling card may have to be more obvious .
9538	324	Perhaps it can email itself , so to speak , to the system’s administrators in the hopes that they will tell the leadership .
9538	325	If the target system is connected to the rest of world—a big if for sensitive systems—it can email itself directly to the target’s leadership .
9538	326	That should work (unless the leaders get it into their heads that it was a trick by their own cyberwar proponents to gain more resources for cyber security ) .
9538	327	The opposite is also possible .
9538	328	If acknowledging a penetration is embarrassing and puts jobs and , in some coun- tries , lives at risk , such hints may be erased by embarrassed system administrators .
9538	329	Revealing a secret that could only have been stolen from such a system eliminates the problem of post hoc erasure but introduces the question of whether the information could have come only from system penetration ( rather than , say , spies ) .
9538	330	The next difficulty is proving that the ability to penetrate a system at will is something that matters .
9538	331	If , as noted , a proven penetration is a one-time event , the target may convince itself that it can take measures to ensure that a repeat performance will be impossible .
9538	332	Or the victim may tolerate the attacker’s ability to stay on the system precisely because it finds pen- etration less intolerable than the cost of hitting a systemic reset button .
9538	333	Such an assessment automatically puts an upper limit on the demonstration effect of the cyberattack .
9538	334	Furthermore , the effectiveness of the penetration has everything to do with the sensitivity of the system being penetrated .
9538	335	This requires understanding which systems are critical to the target and whose penetration would be impressive .
9538	336	If the target’s political power relies on the correct operation of systems that are not only electronically isolated but also hidden , penetration into lesser systems may leave little impression on the target .
9538	337	Note that penetrating a system and persisting within it require similar skill sets but different technologies .
9538	338	Penetration requires knowledge of vulner- abilities ; persistence requires knowing how to evade intrusion and anomaly detection systems .
9538	339	Does the ability to break into a system prove the ability to break a system ?
9538	340	From a tech - nical perspective , no .
9538	341	Contrary to some assertions , the ability to read files does not imply the ability to write to them , hence to alter them , just as the ability to watch Netflix videos on a laptop does not imply the laptop’s ability to edit such videos .
9538	342	Breaking a system requires not the Broad effects of Brandishing Cyberattack Capabilities 7 only breaking into administrator ( or otherwise privileged ) accounts but also figuring out how to induce a system to fail and keep failing despite many features designed to prevent that .
9538	343	But from a psychological perspective , perhaps the ability to break into a system does prove the abil- ity to break a system—especially if the target leadership cannot discern the difference between breaking into and breaking .
9538	344	If the penetration—a violation , as it were—comes as a shock , the prospect of further implications may startle the leadership—regardless of how technically unfounded such implications are .
9538	345	Breaking a system , however , is a more hostile , and more difficult , act than breaking into a system .
9538	346	It requires understanding the characteristic failure modes of the system .
9538	347	Creating nec- essary effects also requires shaping the attack so that the target’s system administrators cannot detect and repair the system very quickly , with the definition of “very quickly ” being neces - sarily specific to the context .
9538	348	An attack on a logistics system might have to last days or weeks before crippling its user population .
9538	349	An attack on surface-to-air missile systems , however , only has to disable the systems for the few minutes that attack aircraft are overhead .
9538	350	Nevertheless , it is unclear how fast recovery can be : The history of cyberattacks that require urgent fixes is thin , and documentation from victims of such attacks is even thinner .
9538	351	Perhaps cyberattackers ( here and elsewhere ) have endeavored to estimate adversary responses by simulating attacks on their own systems and testing their own system administrators ’ ability to recover their functionality .
9538	352	Even if so , the challenge of conveying to others that their attacks can keep their systems down for long periods of time is not easy .
9538	353	The intended audiences of such a demonstration may be able to determine what flaw allowed such an attack , fix the flaw , and recover some confidence in their own systems .
9538	354	If so , for brandishing to work , such cyberattack capabilities must be demonstrated repeatedly .
9538	355	Furthermore , the line between brandishing a capability and employing it can become very thin .
9538	356	Supposedly , the purpose of brandishing is to reduce the other side’s willingness to challenge the possessor of cyberattack capabilities .
9538	357	But employing a capability tends to have the opposite effect : It increases the other side’s desire to challenge the possessor .
9538	358	It is human nature to hit back .
9538	359	In cyberspace , as with other modes of conflict , brandishing can backfire .
9538	360	One possible way out of this dilemma is to demonstrate the ability to crash another per- son’s system by demonstrating the ability to manipulate it in ways that , if continued or carried out in other contexts , could demonstrably break it .
9538	361	For example , the demonstrated ability to put a blank spot on a radar during normal operations implies the ability to put one there when the radar is tracking a hostile object .
9538	362	The ability to raise the temperature of someone else’s chemical process by one degree may imply the ability to raise the temperature enough to cause serious damage , including destruction of the equipment .
9538	363	Inducing a random blank spot or jig- gling the temperature may be hostile attacks but not acts of war .
9538	364	Yet they may suffice to suggest that interference with operations or destroying a chemical facility—which may well be acts of war—are within the attacker’s capability .
9538	365	The usual caveats apply .
9538	366	Such demonstrations have to be conveyed to leaders , and such demonstrations are self-limiting if they induce corrections within target systems that complicate repetition .
9538	367	For some systems , jiggling one parameter slightly may not imply the ability to do so dangerously if safeguards exist .
9538	368	8 Brandishing Cyberattack Capabilities Inducing Fear , Uncertainty , and Doubt Nuclear arms fostered fear , but there was not a great deal of doubt or uncertainty about their applications .2
9538	369	Cyber may be the opposite—incapable of inducing real fear directly , it may be capable of raising the specter of doubt and uncertainty , especially in the minds of those who might wonder if their military systems and hence their military would work when needed .
9538	370	This would cause queasiness if they had to use force of dubious reliability .
9538	371	The target state need not believe that it will lose a war it otherwise would have won were it not for such implanted logic bombs .
9538	372	To echo Mearsheimer’s argument on conventional deterrence ,3 it suffices if the poten- tial attacker believes that its odds of winning quickly are not good enough because its systems have been compromised .
9538	373	An uncertainty-and-doubt strategy may work to the U.S. advantage by persuading other states to be very careful in pursuing a network-centric high-technology force to counter U.S. military capabilities .
9538	374	This means it may be dissuasive .
9538	375	A lot depends on how other states react to the idea that hackers have penetrated their military systems and left behind implants , which , when triggered , could generate rogue messages , alter sensor data , create network dropouts , and even make weapons fail .4
9538	376	It is possible to conclude that , if the target state believes that ( 1 ) it has been so hacked , ( 2 ) has no alternative but the systems and equipment it has , ( 3 ) its estimate of war’s outcomes are decidedly worse as a result , and ( 4 ) it has a choice on whether to go to war , the state’s desire to go to war would decrease .
9538	377	How might such doubt and uncertainty be induced ?
9538	378	The most straightforward way is to hack into such systems and then make it obvious that they have indeed been hacked .
9538	379	Claiming responsibility is unnecessary because the point is to emphasize not U.S. power but the vulner- ability of targeted systems to cyberattacks in a way that leaves their owners doubting their own systems .
9538	380	But if the point is not to provide proof but to instill uncertainty , making the result obvious beforehand is unnecessary .
9538	381	In fact , it may be unwise if the first demonstration makes the next one harder to accomplish .
9538	382	Thus , proving a system was , is , and will stay hacked may be impossible .
9538	383	However , the hint of an attack leaves no specific trace and hence no specific fix .
9538	384	Even if system owners react to rumors by making general fixes , such as selective disconnection or the installation of anti-malware guards , there will be nothing that suggests which of these general fixes worked .
9538	385	In some cases , rumor can be more powerful than fact .
9538	386	After all , it takes , on average , twice as long to find nothing in a room as to find something there .
9538	387	Worse , if finding something is conclusive but sweeping and finding nothing is inconclusive , it takes far longer than twice as long to know that one has found nothing than to find something .
9538	388	System owners may be 2 Astute readers may see the term , “fear , uncertainty , and doubt , ” a phrase Gene Amdahl coined after leaving IBM , to describe the effect that IBM people “instill[ed ] in the minds of potential customers who might be considering Amdahl products . ”
9538	389	3 John J. Mearsheimer , Conventional Deterrence , Ithaca , N.Y. : Cornell University Press , 1985 .
9538	390	4 Although the psychological effects of a cyberwar attack are speculative , it may well exceed its real effects .
9538	391	For example , if one just counts the number of centrifuges that destroyed themselves , Stuxnet can account for only a few months ’ delay in Iran’s nuclear program .
9538	392	But , to get a bomb , Iran must commit to enriching uranium from 3 percent (U-235 ) to 90 percent .
9538	393	During the months required to do this , Western militaries may well react with alarm and force .
9538	394	If Iran cannot convince itself that Stuxnet has not been eradicated , it may conceivably fear that its centrifuges may be ordered to break down in those critical months , exposing Iran to retribution without gaining a bomb for its pains—thereby giving it pause when contemplating going ahead . the Broad effects of Brandishing Cyberattack Capabilities 9 unable to rest assured that , having found supposedly rogue code will solve the problem because there is no proof that what was found was the rogue code that rumors referred to ; such code could be a glitch unrelated to any malevolent actor or could have been placed there by a third party .
9538	395	A great deal depends on what others are predisposed to believe about U.S. capabilities with technology in general .
9538	396	U.S. cyberwarriors need never reveal the techniques of this or that manipulation but just ensure there are enough hints out there that say they do have the requi- site skills .
9538	397	Subjecting that belief to a test could lead to failure and break the spell they may be under .
9538	398	It cannot be overemphasized that the target of the attack is not the system itself but confi- dence in that system and any other system an adversary depends on .
9538	399	What helps is the ability to convince others that they cannot protect their systems even after painstaking attention to their security .
9538	400	They may have checked everything three times .
9538	401	Yet the cyberwarriors find their way in .
9538	402	The effect is necessarily prospective rather than ret- rospective ; it is rare these days that people are attacked ; the attack makes the news ; and yet there is no good idea how the attack was carried out or at least what vulnerability was exploited to enable the attack .5
9538	403	Many of the instruments of the attack remain with the target system , nestled in its log files , or even in the malware itself .
9538	404	Even if the targets of the attack ( e .g. , the Iranians ) cannot figure out what was done or how it was done ( e .g. , Stuxnet ) , there may be others who can ( e .g. , the Belarus firm , VirusBlokAda ) .
9538	405	The number of prominent attacks whose workings , notably penetration and propagation methods , remain a mystery is small , perhaps zero .
9538	406	To be sure , certain attack methods , notably distributed denial of service , contain no prospective , let alone retrospective , mystery as to how they work ; they rely primarily on brute force .
9538	407	Furthermore , anyone who follows the news will understand the ubiquity of hack - ing .
9538	408	It is no great exaggeration to posit that any information of interest to a sophisticated state sitting on a system connected to the Internet has long ago escaped .
9538	409	At this juncture , there are too many vulnerabilities associated with web scripting ( e .g. , Java ) and document-presentation programs to feel very secure .
9538	410	The vulnerability of less-sophisticated states to the possibility that others are inside their systems is enhanced when the target does not really understand the technology behind its own weapon systems .
9538	411	Although sophisticated states can be counted on to know military hardware better than unsophisticated states do , the difference is usually a matter of degree .
9538	412	Sophisticated militaries get more from their equipment : An F-16 is likely to be more effective in the hands of an American pilot than in the hands of a typical third-world pilot .
9538	413	Advanced militaries also maintain their equipment better .
9538	414	Still , even an inexpertly flown and indifferently maintained F-16 is a war machine .
9538	415	An information system , though , may have a negative value in the hands of users unso - phisticated or indifferent about security .
9538	416	Poorly defended systems may , under pressure , leak information , buckle unexpectedly , or provide bad data to warfighters and other decisionmak - ers .
9538	417	In cyberwar , a great hacker can be orders of magnitude more efficacious than a merely good one in ways that do not characterize the difference between a great hardware repairman and a merely good hardware repairman .
9538	418	The difficulty that less-advanced countries have in 5 When attack code is encrypted , the decryption process may be very slow if even possible .
9538	419	Part of Stuxnet was encrypted but later broken .
9538	420	As of mid-August 2012 , Kaspersky , a major security firm , was unable to break the encryption in the Gauss malware and issued a public call for assistance ( Jeff Goldman , “Kaspersky Seeks Help Decrypting Gauss Malware Payload , ” eSecurity Planet , August 15 , 2012 ) .
9538	421	10 Brandishing Cyberattack Capabilities generating impressive cyberattack capabilities may be attributed to poorer educational facilities and a less well-educated recruitment base .
9538	422	Yet their lack of access to others ’ source code or their not having built any of their own and having few among them who have ever built any opera - tional source code helps ensure their military systems are far more vulnerable to cyberattack than comparable systems of sophisticated states .
9538	423	Third-world nations with turnkey systems are also more likely to be using standard configurations and operating procedures , making attacks on them more predictable than attacks on those who understand their systems well enough to tune them to their unique circumstances .
9538	424	Unless such countries are under official U.S. sanc - tion , their systems could very well be maintained by U.S. firms .
9538	425	If cloud computing comes to match the current enthusiasm of its vendors , critical components of domestic control systems may be stored in other countries and be operated by other entities , of which U.S. firms now appear the most likely hosts .
9538	426	Would Such a Strategy Work with Russia and China ?
9538	427	With Russia , the answer is almost certainly not .
9538	428	First , Russian capabilities at cyberwarfare are very advanced , as befits a state so devoted to maskirovka and blessed with a surfeit of world - class mathematicians .6
9538	429	Russians may fear U.S. military capabilities , particularly in electronics , but are unlikely to regard them as particularly puzzling (especially if electronics are not part of the cyberwar package ) .
9538	430	Second , Russia’s military long suit is not the systems integration of complex electronics and networks .
9538	431	It is precisely because they lack confidence in their conven- tional military that they lean so heavily on their nuclear arsenal .
9538	432	Thus , it is unlikely that their investment strategy would be diverted by the U.S. development of cyberweapons .
9538	433	With China , the answer is probably not .
9538	434	China has certainly shown enthusiasm for cyber- war .
9538	435	It appears in their doctrine and in the great volume of intrusions people attribute to them .
9538	436	Chinese talents in cyberspace lean more toward quantity , as befits a focus on cyberespionage ( and deep pools of well-trained but cheap labor ) , than toward the sort of quality required to get into hardened military systems .
9538	437	Furthermore , China ’s military investment strategy is quite different from Russia’s .
9538	438	The Chinese have less interest in achieving nuclear parity and more interest in pursuing anti-access strategies that rely on sensors , surveillance , and missiles , which normally require high levels of systems integration , hence networking.7
9538	439	These factors leave some—but only some—scope for a U.S. dissuasion posture based on using cyberwar capabili- ties against China .
9538	440	How the Fear of Penetration Might Affect Enemy Operational Behavior One purpose in demonstrating cyberwar capabilities is to force states to take the potential for system failure and consequential embarrassment into account and curb their enthusiasm for 6 Makirovka is a Russian term meaning “disguise , camouflage , concealment . ”

9538	444	But would it ?
9538	445	Perhaps not .
9538	446	First , when it comes to war , nearly all defenders and a surpris - ing percentage of attackers believe that they have been put into a position where they have no choice but to wage war because the alternative is worse , e.g. , fighting later would put them at a greater disadvantage—so the Japanese believed in 1941 or the Germans in 1914 .
9538	447	Fear has already failed to deter them .
9538	448	Second , how badly do countries contemplating such actions need high-technology systems to succeed ?
9538	449	Many high-technology systems ( e .g. , electronic warfare ) are needed only against similarly sophisticated opponents , not , say , guerillas .
9538	450	A threat that looks big in peacetime ( when systems are vulnerable by dint of being connected ) may look smaller in wartime ( when systems are configured for survival , in part by being disconnected from the outside world ) .
9538	451	Finally , the target may simply not believe that U.S. cyber capabilities are good enough to stymie military forces completely—not during peacetime and certainly not when the war drums sound .
9538	452	Going to war requires surmounting a great many fears ; the fear of penetration may simply be another .
9538	453	Persuading third parties that there is a ready-to-go gremlin in their systems carries other risks .
9538	454	At a minimum , if they keep their wits , they will likely pay more attention to operational security after U.S. cyberattack capabilities have been brandished .
9538	455	Any belief that the vector into their systems is a spy will induce them to practice more personnel security .
9538	456	If the winds of alliance shift and the United States has to fight together with such countries , hints of penetra - tion may make it difficult for the United States to work with new partners .
9538	457	Previously benign liaisons with a target country may become more difficult if the “partner ” suspects that interact- ing with U.S. forces reveals how its systems are operated and networked and thus where and how the United States could implant malware in them to the best effect .
9538	458	Once other states think the United States is behind their fears , reality may be second - ary .
9538	459	Countries that are certain that their militaries have been attacked may be less inclined to blame their neighbors , whom they may not credit with enough sophistication to pull off such an attack , and more apt to blame a technologically advanced country , such as the United States or Israel .
9538	460	Indeed , the spread of cyberattack capabilities makes it easy for such countries to hold the United States responsible for any failure in military equipment , even for accidents or human error .
9538	461	The instinct to blame others predates cyberspace : Egypt convinced itself , for a few days in June 1967 , that the Israelis could not have destroyed its air forces , so the Ameri- cans had to have done it .
9538	462	Militaries that can give themselves a pass from their public by using such an excuse may be insulated from the effects of their own mistakes and may maintain their influence and power longer than they should .
9538	463	Alternatively , to the extent that such lead- ers themselves come to believe their excuses , they may fail to learn from their own mistakes , which may actually help the United States .
9538	464	Target militaries may also conclude that depending on foreign sources for logic - processing devices is dangerous .
9538	465	This could spur them to build more indigenous production capability or , alternatively , to pressure their suppliers to hand over the source code with the systems .
9538	466	Both can be negatives for the United States to the extent that they are currently being supplied by U.S. corporations .
9538	467	The same suspicions may color the target’s agenda toward civil- ian gear , such as routers , used in their networks .
9538	468	In response , they may pursue indigenization , more-transparent source code , and better cyberdefense training .
9538	469	If they convince themselves that adherence to the Windows/Intel standard is the root of the U.S. ability to hack their sys - tems , they may lean toward more-open operating systems or make common cause with other 12 Brandishing Cyberattack Capabilities countries , such as China , that are striving to build a foundational layer from components and code not believed to be controlled by U.S. companies .8
9538	470	The problem does not go away if the hints that other systems have been penetrated turn out to be baseless .
9538	471	Assume that the United States has convinced others that it can interfere with anyone’s military equipment .
9538	472	Then a war breaks out and no equipment fails in an unexplained way .
9538	473	Observers will conclude that the United States chose not to disrupt the sophisticated sys - tems of one side .
9538	474	If only one side’s equipment works , others may assume this to be proof that the United States must have played favorites and even blame the United States for atrocities associated with such military equipment .
9538	475	They may not pay attention to counterarguments : The United States hinted “might ” not “would” ; it cannot afford to get into everyone’s equip - ment ; some equipment is inaccessible to the outside ; other equipment , such as AK-47s , simply has no electronics to get into .
9538	476	Until the hints started flying , no one could imagine that mili- tary equipment could be remotely disabled—but afterward , no one could imagine the United States not being able to do it .
9538	477	How Fears of Penetration Might Affect Defense Investments A state afraid of penetration could pursue compensatory strategies .
9538	478	It may observe that the effects of cyberattacks are temporary and difficult to repeat .
9538	479	It then maintains its investment strategy after convincing itself that , even if its weapons do not work when first used , it can survive the initial exchange and regain efficacy for later rounds of conflict .
9538	480	Such a perspective would have to overlook the ability of high-technology militaries to conclude successful conven- tional campaigns over the course of days rather than months or years .
9538	481	That is , there may not be a second round .
9538	482	A sophisticated system owner may be able to find and patch a newly exploited vulnerability within hours or days after it has been discovered , especially with outside help .
9538	483	But can an unsophisticated system owner on the outs with the developed world and countering a sophisticated U.S. cyberattack count on so quick a recovery ?
9538	484	The state may also realize that , once a system has become ill , warfighters may not want to bet their lives on it until it has been provably cured , a lengthier process than simply having its symptoms relieved .
9538	485	If states anticipate that their networked systems may be penetrated , they may foreswear network-centric warfare .
9538	486	Why try to face foes with weapons that may well fail spectacularly when used ? Conversely , for the United States , if it really can defeat the other side’s network - centric military capabilities , why would it want to dissuade them from building and depend - ing on them ?
9538	487	One reason might be that the United States cannot be certain it can defeat such capabilities but wants to persuade others it can .
9538	488	Another may be that it may want to dissuade a military buildup because it would lead to a more-aggressive security policy and therefore lead it to start or carry on a conflict when U.S. security would be better served by its not trying to use such capabilities rather than by its subsequent defeat when it did .
9538	489	However , if the United 8 Iran is even going so far as to disconnect its Internet from the rest of the world’s .
9538	490	From Christopher Rhoads and Farnaz Fassihi , “Iran Vows to Unplug Internet , ” Wall Street Journal , May 28 , 2011 : On Friday , new reports emerged in the local press that Iran also intended to roll out its own computer operating system in coming months to replace Microsoft Corp.’s Windows .
9538	491	The development , which could not be independently confirmed , was attributed to Reza Taghipour , Iran’s communication minister .
9538	492	See also “Iran to Unveil National OS Soon , ” PressTV , January 4 , 2011 .
9538	493	the Broad effects of Brandishing Cyberattack Capabilities 13 States believed that the other side would go ahead anyhow , it may be better off keeping quiet about its confidence that it can defeat such capabilities .
9538	494	The target’s counterstrategy may be to rely on lower-tech weapons that are robust against cyberattack because they are never connected to anything .
9538	495	So , if U.S. adversaries forgo net- working , is an uncertainty-and-doubt strategy thereby defeated or has it triumphed ?
9538	496	Would success in dissuading a potential adversary from a high-technology challenge be in the best U.S. interest ?
9538	497	Much depends on the kind of wars the United States is worried about .
9538	498	If the goal is to make it very difficult to use conventional forces to defend against invasion or coercion ( rather than fight an insurgency ) , low-technology forces are no match for the United States .
9538	499	Sacrificing quality may provide others the means to pursue quantity , but , so far , the trade-off for others has not been particularly good ; quality usually triumphs .
9538	500	A more subtle counterstrategy is to network warfighting machines that stay off the Web and forget about networking people .
9538	501	This has the advantages of permitting air-gapping as a defense strategy and avoids some of the vulnerabilities arising from hu
