## Project 

Network of searchable leaks (*new/s/leak*) is a research project producing a software prototype that allows to quickly and intuitively explore large amounts of textual data. The tool will support journalists working with datasets like the [Afghan War Diary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_War_documents_leak), the [U.S. diplomatic cables leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak) (both distributed by [Wikileaks](https://wikileaks.org/) in 2010), or the hacking of [The Hacking Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacking_Team#2015_data_breach) (2014). The goal is to provide a quick access to important entities (people, organizations, places) and their relationships, and how their usage changes over time. 

## Collaboration

The new/s/leak project is a collaboration between Hamburg University (Department of [language technology](https://lt.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/)), Darmstadt University (department of [information visualization](https://www.gris.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/home/index.de.htm)) and [Der Spiegel](https://www.spiegel.de). In 2016 and 2018, the project was funded by the [Volkswagenstiftung](https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/) as a part of the initiative “Science and Data Journalism”.
