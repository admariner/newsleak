new/s/leak (NetWork of Searchable Leaks) is a research project producing a piece of software that allows to quickly and intuitively explore large amounts of textual data. The tool will support journalists working with datasets like the [War Diaries](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-wikileaks-iraq-war-logs-greatest-data-leak-in-us-military-history-a-724845.html) or the [Embassy cables](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/28/us-embassy-cable-leak-diplomacy-crisis) (both distributed by [Wikileaks](https://wikileaks.org)) or the [hacking of Hacking Team](https://labs.rs/en/metadata/). The goal is to provide a quick access to important entities (people, organizations, places) and their relationships, and how those things change over time. Based on the [Network of the Day](http://tagesnetzwerk.de), our software will combine the latest research in language technology and information visualization to create a powerful tool for searching and exploring: it will be easy to use and understand, with a pleasant look-and-feel.

The new/s/leak project is a collaboration between TU Darmstadt (Departments of [language technology](https://www.lt.tu-darmstadt.de/de/lt-home/) and [information visualization](http://www.gris.tu-darmstadt.de/research/vissearch/index.en.htm)) and [DER SPIEGEL](http://www.spiegel.de). [VW Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Foundation) funds this project for a period of 9 months (January - September 2016) as a part of the initiative "[Science and Data Journalism](https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/aktuelles/aktdetnewsl/news/detail/artikel/wissenschaft-und-datenjournalismus-start-von-acht-projekten/marginal/4858.html)''. The whole project budget goes to the departments of TU Darmstadt - SPIEGEL has waived any funding for this project. As the projects' media partner, SPIEGEL delivers data for the project and, above all, is excited about the development of research-driven software facilitating the work of all journalists concerned with data.
