## User Setup

To run newsleak, you need to install two dependent projects first.

### Docker

We distribute newsleak as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com) setup, orchestrated by `docker-compose`.

So please, install first `docker` and `docker-compose` on your system.

### Hoover

For easy data import, we rely on the Hoover toolset. To import data into newsleak, you must first have it imported into a local instance of Hoover.

To install Hoover and import a test collection, please follow the instructions on [this Github page](https://github.com/hoover/docker-setup).

### Newsleak

After a successfull installation and data import in Hoover, you can install and run newsleak.

For this, follow the instructions on [this Github page](https://github.com/uhh-lt/newsleak-docker).


## Development setup
