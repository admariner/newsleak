We present new/s/leak at a panel discussion atÂ WissensWerte 2018, Germany's most important dialogue forum for science journalists. On November 20, 2018 together with panelists from journalism, IT startups, and other universities, we will discuss how artificial intelligence contributes to journalistic work. In case of new/s/leak, we employ machine learning to automatically extract relevant information such as named entities and keywords from texts. This enables us to create interactive comprehensive visualizations of large text collections which contribute to a fast exploration for investigative purposes.
