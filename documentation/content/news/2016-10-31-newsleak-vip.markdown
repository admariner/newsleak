Last week, new/s/leak had its academic debut in the visualization science community at the [Visualization in Practice Workshop](http://visinpractice.org/), co-located with the [IEEE VIS 2016 conference](http://ieeevis.org/).

Here is the [paper](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Group_LangTech/publications/newsleak-VIP-latest.pdf) documenting the software with a focus on visualization. Needless to say that it's always fun to present new/s/leak and get more feedback:

Thanks to everyone who came and visited us!
