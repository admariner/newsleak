Last week, we presented new/s/leak for the first time in public: we had our demo session at the [annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics](http://acl2016.org), which was held in Berlin this year.
If you haven't had the chance to attend (or you had and want to have some references now):



	  * Here's the [paper](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-4028.pdf) documenting our software (you'll find a large part of the information from the paper in this blog, too)
	  * Here's our [poster (in PDF format)](http://newsleak.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ACL2016_newsleak_Poster.pdf)

And, of course, we took some pictures, testifying how much fun we had (click for larger versions):
