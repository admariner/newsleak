This Saturday, we present new/s/leak at the European investigative journalism conference (EIJC). Here you can find the slides of our presentation about ["Information Extraction and Visualisation for Investigative Journalism"](http://www.newsleak.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/newsleak_mechelen.pdf).

If you are interested to try new/s/leak with your own data, visitÂ the [Github page containing the Docker setup](https://github.com/tudarmstadt-lt/newsleak-docker) of our application.

In June, we will publish a detailed blog post on how to setup Hoover and Newsleak to analyze collections on your own machines.
