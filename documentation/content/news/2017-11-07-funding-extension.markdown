We are happy to announce that the new/s/leak project receives some additional funding from the Volkswagen Stiftung. Until summer 2018, new/s/leak will be extended and refactored to achieve the following goals:



 	  * easy deployment for own usage
 	  * comprehensive and detailed documentation
 	  * improved user interface
 	  * improved information extraction (better keyterm extraction, named entity recognition, support of user dictionaries)
 	  * support for multiple languages (among others english, german, spanish, french, arabic, chinese)

Follow the updates on this blog to see how far we got :)
