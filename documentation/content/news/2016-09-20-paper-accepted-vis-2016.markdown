Our Paper "_new\s\leak -- A Tool for Visual Exploration of Large Text Document Collections in the Journalistic Domain_" has been accepted for presentation at the poster session of the [Visualization in Practice Workshop](http://visinpractice.org), which is part of the [IEEE VIS 2016 conference](http://ieeevis.org). The workshop will take place in Baltimore Maryland, USA on October 24-25.

VIS is one of the most important conferences in visualization science. new/s/leak fits perfectly in this year's VIP workshop, the focus of which is design, development, distribution, and application of open source visualization and visual analytics software.

Meet us at the demo session in Baltimore!
