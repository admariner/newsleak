The paper "A Multilingual Information Extraction Pipeline for Investigative Journalism" focusing on the information extraction component of new/s/leak 2.0 has been accepted at the software demonstrations track of the [2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing](https://emnlp2018.org/)
The conference paper is available in the ACL anthology ([here](https://aclweb.org/anthology/papers/D/D18/D18-2014/)). 

**Abstract:** We introduce an advanced information extraction pipeline to automatically process very large collections of unstructured textual data for the purpose of investigative journalism. The pipeline serves as a new input processor for the upcoming major release of our New/s/leak 2.0 software, which we develop in cooperation with a large German news organization. The use case is that journalists receive a large collection of files up to several Gigabytes containing unknown contents. Collections may originate either from official disclosures of documents, e.g. Freedom of Information Act requests, or unofficial data leaks.
