Since the first version of Newsleak, a lot has been improved behind the scenes as well as in the front-end of the software. We want to encourage journalists, to try out a pre-release of Newsleak 2.0 on their own. For this, we provide a software demonstration. This demo is populated with ca. 26,500 documents collected from Wikipedia in four languages (English, German, Hungarian and Spanish) and mostly centered on the topic of World War II. The idea behind this demo is to show you the analysis capabilities to quickly explore a large, multilingual collection.

For lazy clickers, we provide a Youtube video where you can follow a proceeding of an exploratory analysis and filtering process drilling down to some details of inner-Chinese political tensions during WW2.
