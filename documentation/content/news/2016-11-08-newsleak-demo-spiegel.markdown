Now that we're in the middle of new/s/leak's home stretch, we had a final demo at SPIEGEL in Hamburg. After some exciting and productive development sprints, weÂ proudly introduced the software to journalists, documentarists and software developers, who gave us the best feedback by playing around with the tool and becoming absorbed in using it. Some evidence:

We also collected some more systematic feedback, which helped us prioritizing the remaining tasks. Thanks to everyone who came along, played and gave feedback - we had a blast at the meeting, and we learned a lot!


During the upcoming weeks until Christmas, we'll add some more requested features, fix some bugs, and create an easy-to-deliver software package. Stay tuned for a deployable version!
