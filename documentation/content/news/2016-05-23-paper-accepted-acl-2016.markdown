Our paper _"new/s/leak – Information Extraction and Visualization for an Investigative Data Journalists"_ was accepted for the Systems Demonstration Track at [ACL 2016](http://acl2016.org)!

ACL is the most important conference for computational linguistics, and we will present new/s/leak there. Stay tuned for the final paper version - and our publicly available prototype.

Looking forward to meeting you in Berlin!
